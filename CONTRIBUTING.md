# How to contribute

- You can send a pull request resolving an issue with this rules:
  - Write all in english.
  - Use the present tense infinitive when making commit messages
  - Do TDD if it is possible (write a test, then implement, then refactor)
  - Follow this example workflow:

1. Chose an issue of this repo.
2. Work on the task: You create a new branch in your local repository to work on the task: git checkout -b add-form-validation.
3. Make commits: As you progress, you make commits with messages referencing the issue: git commit -m "Add basic form validation #10".
4. Complete the task: Once the task is finished, you make a final commit that closes the issue: git commit -m "Complete form validation, closes #10".
5. Run all the unit tests to ensure that nothing is broken
6. Make a pull request of your branch
